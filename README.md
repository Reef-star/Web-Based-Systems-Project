Pets Heaven is an online pet product e-commerce platform developed as part of the Web-Based Systems (CIS423) course at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University. The project aims to provide pet owners with a simple, functional online shopping experience featuring essentials such as product browsing, cart management, and admin-based product control.

This repository contains the current working version of the project as submitted for Milestone 2. It includes:

- A basic front-end built with HTML and CSS

- PHP-based form handling and admin login

- A normalized MySQL database (Pets_Heaven.sql)

- Interfaces for homepage, product view, shopping cart, admin panel, and contact page

⚠️ Note: This project is still in development and does not yet include complete checkout functionality, JavaScript form validation, cookies for past purchases, or Google Maps integration. These features will be implemented in the final milestone.
